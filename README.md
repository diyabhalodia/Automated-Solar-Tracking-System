# Automated-Solar-Tracking-System

# Overview
This project implements a dual-axis solar tracking system using Arduino, Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs), and servo motors to automatically adjust the orientation of a solar panel, maximizing light absorption and improving energy efficiency by 20-30%.

# Components
1) Arduino (Uno/Nano)
2) LDRs (4 sensors)
3) Servo Motors (2 for dual-axis movement)
4) Jumper Wires and Power Supply

# How It Works
The system uses LDRs to sense light intensity from four directions (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
The Arduino processes sensor data and adjusts the servo motors to position the solar panel toward the strongest light source, optimizing energy capture.

# Setup
Connect LDRs and servos to the Arduino.
Upload the code from this repository using the Arduino IDE.
Power the system and watch it track the light!

# Features
Dual-Axis Tracking: Adjusts both vertically and horizontally.
Energy Efficient: Improves light capture by 20-30%.
Affordable: Built with open-source, cost-effective components.
